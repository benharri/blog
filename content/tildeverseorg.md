since the last time i wrote a post here, i've registered the
tildeverse.org domain and started moving some services over that were
already intended for tildeverse use.

among those are [gitea](https://git.tildeverse.org) and [the new link
aggregator](https://links.tildeverse.org) (which runs the same source as
[lobste.rs](https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters)).

i've also started a phlog in my
[gopherhole](https://gopher.tilde.team/tilde.team/~ben) with
[~tomasino's](/~tomasino) new
[burrow](https://github.com/jamestomasino/burrow) gopherhole tool!

i'll try to post a bit more often too with updates from the tildeverse!
