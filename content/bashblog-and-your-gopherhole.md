i've created [a repo](https://git.tildeverse.org/meta/bashblog) for the
tilde.team customizations to
[bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog).

it will now make sure that your ~/public\_gopher exists and symlink your
blog into it with a nice gophermap to list all the markdown styled
posts.

try it out and let me know if there are any problems!
