\#BlueLivesMatter completely misses the point. And it makes #AllLivesMatter hypocritical.

This cartoon says it all. 

The same people that pioneered the #AllLivesMatter movement are now claiming that #BlueLivesMatter. Do they not understand the irony of this?

By claiming that all lives matter, this minimizes the importance of lives that currently need the attention, much like the house on fire in the cartoon above.
