Everybody! We only have UNTIL TOMORROW to fight the FCC & the repeal of
\#NetNeutrality! Repealing Net Nutrality would result in an unequal
access to online content including research, social/political
organizing, and personal media. It would also allow powerhouse companies
providing internet to charge more for regular quality internet, and
charge certain users more than others. HERE'S A WAY TO ACT - takes less
than a minute.

1.  Go to [gofccyourself.com](http://gofccyourself.com) (the shortcut
    John Oliver made to the hard-to-find FCC comment page)
2.  Click on the 17-108 link (Restoring Internet Freedom)
3.  Click on "express"
4.  Be sure to hit "ENTER" after you put in your name & info so it
    registers.
5.  In the comment section write, "I strongly support net neutrality
    backed by Title 2 oversight of ISPs."
6.  Click to submit, done. - Make sure you hit submit at the end!

**Copy and paste this into your own status update!** Seriously, this is
simple and so important. Do it.
