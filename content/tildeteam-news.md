hey hi hello!

it seems that i haven't written anything on my blog in quite a while...

time to fix that! i've been quite busy in the last month or so with a
lot of new ideas an energy for tilde.team.

after rediscovering my account on tilde.town, i hopped in the irc there
and my enthusiasm translated into a couple new members over here on the
~team.

our irc has been somewhat more active recently which is awesome:)

some of the new updates in the last month:

-   [tildegit (our own gitea instance)](https://git.tilde.team)
-   [tildemail](https://mail.tilde.team) with postfix and dovecot for
    smtp/imap as well as local command line mail in mutt and alpine
-   [`tilde`](https://git.tildeverse.org/team/tilde-launcher) user
    script wrapper with submission and approval flows
-   [password auth disabled](https://tilde.team/wiki/?page=ssh)

i'd like to make use of our new mailserver, so shoot me some
[mail](mailto:ben@tilde.team). i never get enough personal mail. it's
all still privacy policy update notices. :(

see you soon!
