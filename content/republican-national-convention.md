I was asked to chaperone a group of youth journalists with 8-18 Media (a youth journalism program in Marquette that I was once a part of)

__Disclaimer:__ these blog posts represent my opinion!

I plan on writing a post for each day of the RNC journaling my thoughts about the event.
+ [__Day One__]({{< relref "rnc-day-one" >}}) - Benghazi and weaponization of grief
+ [__Day Two__]({{< relref "rnc-day-two" >}}) - Make America Work Again (It's already working with a very low unemployment rate)
+ [__Day Three__]({{< relref "rnc-day-three" >}}) - Make America First Again featuring the second and third place candidates from the Republican primary
+ [__Day Four__]({{< relref "rnc-day-four" >}}) - Make America One Again
