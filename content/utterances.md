i somehow stumbled upon [utterances](https://utteranc.es) today at
lunch. (i think someone had it forked on their github page).

no matter how i found it, i still decided to add it to my blog here with
[bashblog](https://tildegit.org/team/bashblog). utterances is a
commenting system that leverages github issues. so, for example a
comment on [a
post](https://tilde.team/~ben/blog/upsides-of-new-dns-nameservers.html)
shows up on github [like
this](https://github.com/benharri/tilde/issues/1#issuecomment-418732788).

now we just need to figure out if it can be pointed at a gitea instance
like [tildegit](https://tildegit.org). might be time for a PR!
