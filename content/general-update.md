it's been quite a long time since i posted anything here on this blog.

i've been playing with [gruvbox-css](https://github.com/xe/gruvbox-css),
decided to switch my blog to use it and finally realized it's been
almost a year since i posted anything at all.

i don't have anything in particular to post today so i figured it would
be good to give a general update since the last time i posted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

we've moved physical hosts again ([/news
post](https://tilde.team/news/028_back_up)), which is now a vm on a
large dedicated machine i rent from
[ovh](%20https://www.ovh.com/world/dedicated-servers/infra/infra-2/). my
current vm setup is proxmox, which i'm quite happy with. the new box is
pricier but has a lot more resources and room to grow.

it appears that i haven't posted anything in so long that i don't yet
have any pictures of my dog on my blog!

i got her last may (2019) and she's the best. she's an english springer
spaniel and her name is Hope.

:)
