not sure if this is appropriately tagged, but i didn't feel like making
a new one.

i figured i should probably get some notes down about moving off google.

to start, i'll get a list of the things i was able to easily replace:

-   gmail =&gt; [@tilde.team mail](https://tilde.team/wiki/?page=email)
-   google drive =&gt; [syncthing](https://syncthing.net) (with a
    persistent node running on my personal vps)

i'm still using:

-   gplay music/youtube
-   google maps (open streetmap isn't good enough to replace it)
-   google photos - but this is going to be replaced long-term with
    syncthing
