This is my first post.

I'm Ben Harris. I study computer science at Northern Michigan University.

I'll be writing about some of the experiences I've had in software and in other areas of my life. 

Some of my hobbies include:
+ writing software
+ biking
+ traveling
+ ultimate frisbee

Thanks for checking out my blog!
