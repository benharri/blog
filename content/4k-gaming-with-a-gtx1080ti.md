i recently picked up a gtx1080ti on newegg (and a 4k monitor earlier in
the summer on prime day). i can't stop playing the witcher 3. even
though it's a couple years old, it just looks so good. plus, the story
and gameplay are incredible as well. i find myself dreaming about the
game and longing to play it when i'm not. i'll have to say it is
definitively the best game i've ever played.

some of the other games that i'm looking forward to exploring more of in
4k are:

-   destiny 2
-   prey
-   overwatch (not that this will look insanely good, it will just be
    super silky smooth)
-   fallout 4
-   battlefield 1
-   dishonored
-   dishonored 2
-   dying light
-   battlefront
-   pubg
-   doom (2016)
-   gta5
-   just cause 3
-   hellblade: senua's sacrifice
-   watch dogs 2
-   many others
