    <hr>

    <p>i finally got sick of some outstanding bashblog bugs and decided to rewrite my blog
with <a href="https://gohugo.io">hugo</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="why-fix-something-that-aint-broken">why fix something that ain&rsquo;t broken?</h2>
<p>there are several <a href="https://tildegit.org/team/bashblog/issues">major bugs</a> in
bashblog that i haven&rsquo;t had the time or interest to fix. luckily, i have my
blog source in a <a href="https://tildegit.org/ben/tilde">git repo</a>, so the messed-up
files are relatively easy to fix up.</p>
<p>my theory is that the cognitive load of dealing with those bugs has been
preventing me from writing any new posts&hellip; (among other current events).</p>
<p>plus i guess i just needed a project!</p>
<h2 id="the-hard-part">the hard part</h2>
<p>it was a bit of a struggle to get my blogposts converted over to a proper format.</p>
<p>bashblog maintains the tags with a plaintext link line at the bottom of the file
and keeps track of modify dates <em>on the filesystem</em> using <code>date -r</code> and <code>touch -t</code>
to keep them up to date.</p>
<p>this makes it hard to work with the blog in any place other than where it&rsquo;s already
deployed live. additionally, parsing the tags to another format was a bit of a headache&hellip;</p>
<p>i ended up writing a little <a href="https://tildegit.org/ben/blog/src/branch/main/fix_dates.sh">script</a>
to pull the timestamp from bashblog&rsquo;s generated html since i no longer had the original
file metadata.</p>
<h2 id="time-to-write-more">time to write more</h2>
<p>i&rsquo;m always tempted to play with the publishing process instead of actually writing.</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see how well i can avoid the temptation now!</p>
