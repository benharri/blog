      <description>here&amp;rsquo;s the longer version about the outage on august 24, 2021:
after finishing the package upgrades on my proxmox hosts for the new release (proxmox 7.0, corresponding to debian 11/bullseye), i typed reboot and pressed enter, crossing my fingers that it would come back up as expected.</description>

      <description>howdy friends!
if you’re a mastodon user on tilde.zone (the tildeverse mastodon instance), you might’ve noticed some downtime recently.
here’s a quick recap of what went down during the upgrade process.</description>

      <description>changing git’s default branch name has come up recently as an easy action we can take to update our language and remove harmful ideas from our daily usage.
i’m concerned that this effort to change the language used is ultimately a symbolic gesture to avoid scrutiny into actual change (notably github’s push for this change and continued contracts with ICE).</description>

      <description>inspired by tomasino&amp;rsquo;s recent post, i&amp;rsquo;d like to detail some of the stuff that i rent and use.
recurring costs some of these are monthly, others are annual

      <description>i&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working on setting up drone ci on the tilde.team machine. however, there&amp;rsquo;s been something strange going on with the networking on there.
starting up drone with docker-compose didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be working: netstat -tulpn showed the port binding properly to 127.</description>

      <description>last week i did some maintenance on the tilde.team box. probably should have written about it sooner but i didn&amp;rsquo;t make time for it until now.
the gist of the problem was that the default images provided by hetzner default to raid1 between the available disks.</description>

      <description>after the fiasco earlier this week, i&amp;rsquo;ve been taking steps to minimize the impact if tilde.team were to go down. it&amp;rsquo;s still a large spof (single-point-of-failure), but i&amp;rsquo;m reasonably certain that at least the irc net will remain up and functional in the event of another outage.</description>

      <description>we had something of an outage on november 13, 2018 on tilde.team.
i awoke, not suspecting anything to be amiss. as soon as i logged in to check my email and irc mentions, it became clear.</description>

      <description>not sure if this is appropriately tagged, but i didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like making a new one.
i figured i should probably get some notes down about moving off google.

      <description>let&amp;rsquo;s start by saying i probably should have done a bit more research before diving head-first into this endeavor.
i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about transferring my domains off google domains for some time now, as part of my personal goal to self host and limit my dependence on google and other large third-party monstrosities.</description>

      <description>I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies.</description>

      <description>Dunkel war’s der Mond schien helle, Schnee bedeckt die grüne Flur als ein Auto blitzeschnelle, langsam um die Ecke fuhr.

Trump is officially the Republican nominee for President of the United States of America.</description>

      <description>Something that struck me as absolutely outrageous (more than other things that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this week) was the connection of the roots of the Republican party to the modern Republican party.</description>

      <description>Something that has been on my mind all week is the utter lack of minority representation at the convention. Inside the security perimeter, most black people that you see are working here.</description>

      <description>#BlueLivesMatter completely misses the point. And it makes #AllLivesMatter hypocritical.
This cartoon says it all.
The same people that pioneered the #AllLivesMatter movement are now claiming that #BlueLivesMatter. Do they not understand the irony of this?</description>

      <description>Michigan delegates to the Republican National Convention got fired up for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie as he addressed them this morning at their first breakfast meeting.
