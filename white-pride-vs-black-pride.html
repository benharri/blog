    <p>What White Nationalists Don&rsquo;t Get</p>
<p>A common and seemingly reasonable argument for white pride or white
nationalism is: why cant I be proud of my culture?</p>
<p>Well, you can. Always have been able to. We have Irish pride
celebrations, we have German drinking festivals, we have Serbian food
festivals. Any European culture you can think of has multiple
organizations in North America dedicated to taking pride in their
heritage and NO ONE gives them shit for it.</p>
<p>But, you see, when you start talking white pride, that&rsquo;s not a culture.
That&rsquo;s a skin color. There is no white culture, never was. There is no
pan-European culture, never was. Europe is a continent, not a culture or
ethnicity.</p>
<p>Now, some of you are probably about to go, but wait! Black pride! How is
that okay? Well, easy. Go find a black person and ask them if their
ancestors were slaves. When you find one who says yes, proceed to ask
them what country in Africa were your ancestors from? Do you know what
their answer will probably be? I don&rsquo;t know. This is because their
culture was taken from them. It was beaten out of them. They were
enslaved, Christianized, and then white washed. The one unifying feature
they have as a people is that history of slavery and that history of
being black. They cant have Liberian pride, or Congolese pride, or
insert African country pride because they have no fucking idea where
their ancestors came from other than the broad region of West Africa.</p>
<p>Meanwhile us white people can often trace our ancestors to specific
cities and regions. I can trace my mothers maiden name to a single
fucking village in Ireland. I know where I came from. I don&rsquo;t have white
culture, I have Irish culture.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why white pride makes you an asshole but black pride actually
makes sense.</p>
