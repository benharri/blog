    <hr>

    <p>i just got back from a 10-day backpacking trip to italy and i&rsquo;d like to
share some of the photos i took!</p>
<p>the travel plan was rome -&gt; venice -&gt; florence -&gt; naples -&gt;
pompei/vesuvius -&gt; capri -&gt; amalfi</p>
<p>this is the roman forum (with colosseum in the background) as seen from
the palatine.</p>

<p>here&rsquo;s me standing next to the same piece of ancient rome as i did the
last time i visited in 2015. see <a href="https://github.com/benharri">my github
profile</a></p>

<p>the inside of st. pete&rsquo;s basilica. climbed the 551 steps to the top of
it for a crazy view of rome.</p>
<p><img src="https://bhh.sh/pub/photos/italy/st-petes.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>venice was the next stop. this is the grand canal.</p>
<p><img src="https://bhh.sh/pub/photos/italy/venice-grand-canal.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>we visited all the main museums in firenze (aka florence, but firenze is
far cooler). this is the view from the roof of our hostel.</p>
<p><img src="https://bhh.sh/pub/photos/italy/firenze.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>after arriving in naples, we headed out to see vesuvius and the ruins of
pompei. i&rsquo;m not sure why pompei has an extra &lsquo;i&rsquo; in english, but it only
has one in modern-day italian. look at the ruts left from the ancience
chariots in the basalt stone!</p>
<p><img src="https://bhh.sh/pub/photos/italy/pompei-ruts.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>here see vesuvius from pompei&rsquo;s main square.</p>
<p><img src="https://bhh.sh/pub/photos/italy/vesuvius-from-pompei.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>we did a tour around the island of capri. (think capri pants, caprese
salads, etc). we also took a chairlift to the top of the island for the
stunning view. unfortunately, photos just don&rsquo;t show the scale and sheer
drop from the cliff.</p>
<p><img src="https://bhh.sh/pub/photos/italy/capri-rocks.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>this is the view from our airbnb in amalfi. it was quite a pain to get
to&hellip; but it was worth it!</p>
<p><img src="https://bhh.sh/pub/photos/italy/airbnb-view.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>here&rsquo;s me and <a href="https://tilde.team/~supercock789/">~supercock789</a>
somewhere along the path of the gods.</p>
<p><img src="https://bhh.sh/pub/photos/italy/me-and-nick.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>what a whirlwind! i&rsquo;m pretty sure we visited all the major tourist
attractions in the cities that we visited. and in quite a short time!</p>
<p>there are <a href="https://bhh.sh/pub/photos/italy/">a few extra photos here</a></p>
<p>thanks for stopping by!</p>
