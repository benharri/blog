      <description>howdy friends!
if you’re a mastodon user on tilde.zone (the tildeverse mastodon instance), you might’ve noticed some downtime recently.
here’s a quick recap of what went down during the upgrade process.</description>

      <description>inspired by tomasino&amp;rsquo;s recent post, i&amp;rsquo;d like to detail some of the stuff that i rent and use.
recurring costs some of these are monthly, others are annual
 server rental  $135/month, 64gb model, 2yr contract discount   proxmox - my preferred hypervisor.</description>

      <description>it&amp;rsquo;s been quite a long time since i posted anything here on this blog.
i&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with gruvbox-css, decided to switch my blog to use it and finally realized it&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since i posted anything at all.</description>

      <description>i&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working on setting up drone ci on the tilde.team machine. however, there&amp;rsquo;s been something strange going on with the networking on there.
starting up drone with docker-compose didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be working: netstat -tulpn showed the port binding properly to 127.</description>

      <description>last week i did some maintenance on the tilde.team box. probably should have written about it sooner but i didn&amp;rsquo;t make time for it until now.
the gist of the problem was that the default images provided by hetzner default to raid1 between the available disks.</description>

      <description>after the fiasco earlier this week, i&amp;rsquo;ve been taking steps to minimize the impact if tilde.team were to go down. it&amp;rsquo;s still a large spof (single-point-of-failure), but i&amp;rsquo;m reasonably certain that at least the irc net will remain up and functional in the event of another outage.</description>

      <description>we had something of an outage on november 13, 2018 on tilde.team.
i awoke, not suspecting anything to be amiss. as soon as i logged in to check my email and irc mentions, it became clear.</description>

      <description>let&amp;rsquo;s start by saying i probably should have done a bit more research before diving head-first into this endeavor.
i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about transferring my domains off google domains for some time now, as part of my personal goal to self host and limit my dependence on google and other large third-party monstrosities.</description>

      <description>now that tilde.team is on a fancy-shmancy new dedi server, i&amp;rsquo;ve tried to get a secondary IP address assigned to a lxd container (which i plan to use for my personal stuff).</description>
